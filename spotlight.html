<h2>3-Day Pass With Camping to Folks Festival</h2>
<h3>Offered Saturday, July 11th</h3>

<p>Drawing to win a 3-Day pass with camping to Folk Festival at Planet Bluegrass August 14th, 15th and 16th.
In the 25 years since we started our modest "summit on the song" the festival has moved (from Estes Park to Lyons in 1994), grown (to our current capacity of 4,000), survived a 500-year flood, and created its own culture, community, and spirit. All the while, Folks Fest has remained true to our initial vision of spending a glorious Colorado summer weekend celebrating songs and stories from around the musical and geographic world. Check out this year's <a href="http://www.bluegrass.com/folks/lineup.html">line-up</a>. http://www.bluegrass.com/folks/lineup.html</p>
